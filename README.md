# typerD
The Typer D. Project has several objectives:

That you can integrate the different concepts of JavaScript and use them in the creation of an interactive game that favors fast and precise writing.

In this Project you will work with Functions, Arrays, Events and you will also manipulate the DOM.
That you learn some functionalities such as generating random words and updating a timer in a timely manner.

May you find a very useful tool to improve your writing and typing skills.


Methodology
ðŸŽ¯ In the user's view, this interactive game develops as follows: you will receive a word in English and you will have to type it into an input in the shortest possible time.

If the typed word matches the one received, it moves on to the next word and extra time is assigned.

When starting the game, the user will have 10 seconds to solve the words presented to them. As you get it right, that time will change in your favor.
